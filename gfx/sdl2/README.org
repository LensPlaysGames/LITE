* SDL2 as a Library

** Dependencies

NOTE: The SDL2 /DEVELOPMENT/ release(s) is/are necessary (don't get runtime binaries).

- SDL2
  - SDL2_ttf

** Notes

*** Windows

Specify SDL2_DIR CMake variable during configuration.
: -DSDL2_DIR=<full path to SDL2 directory containing bin, lib, include>

It is also necessary to set SDL2_TTF_DIR CMake variable to find SDL_TTF extension.
: -DSDL2_TTF_DIR=<full path to SDL2_ttf directory containing bin, lib, include>

NOTE: If the program compiles and links with zero errors, but exits immediately
upon launching the executable, it is likely that the necessary DLLs (~SDL2_ttf.dll~)
are not located in the same folder as the executable.

*** General

NOTE: Because graphical applications exit immediately (at least on Windows),
it is necessary to re-direct the output if you wish to see ~printf()~ output.
PowerShell:
: .\bin\GUI.exe | Out-File .\bin\log.txt ; Get-Contents -Path .\bin\log.txt

Bash:
: bin/GUI.exe > bin/log.txt 2>&1 && cat bin/log.txt
